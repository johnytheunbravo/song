        <h1> Line Without a Hook </h1>
        <h2> Ricky Montgomery </h2>
        <p>I don't really give a damn about the way you touch me <br>
            When we're alone <br>
            You can hold my hand <br>
            If no one's home <br>
            Do you like it when I'm away? <br>
            If I went and hurt my body, baby <br>
            Would you love me the same? <br>
            I can feel all my bones coming back <br>
            And I'm craving motion <br>
            Mama never really learns how to live by herself <br>
            It's a curse <br>
            And it's growing <br>
            You're a pond and I'm an ocean <br>
            Oh, all my emotions <br>
            Feel like explosions when you are around <br>
            And I've found a way to kill the sounds, oh
    </p>
    <p> 
            Oh, baby, I am a wreck when I'm without you <br>
        I need you here to stay <br>
        I broke all my bones that day I found you <br>
        Crying at the lake <br>
        Was it something I said to make you feel like you're a burden? <br>
        Oh, and if I could take it all back
        <br>
        I swear that I would pull you from the tide

    
        <p>Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa <br>
        I said no, I said no <br>
        Listen close, it's a no <br>
        The wind is a-pounding on my back <br>
        And I found hope in a heart attack <br>
        Oh at last, it is past <br>
        Now I've got it, and you can't have it</p>
        <p>
           Baby, I am a wreck when I'm without you <br>
        I need you here to stay <br>
        I broke all my bones that day I found you <br>
        Crying at the lake <br>
        Was it something I said to make you feel like you're a burden? <br>
        Oh, and if I could take it all back
        <br>
        I swear that I would pull you from the tide 
    </p>
    <p>
            Darling, when I'm fast asleep <br>
        I've seen this person watching me <br>
        Saying, "Is it worth it? Is it worth it? Tell me, is it worth it?"<br>
        Because there is something, and there is nothing<br>
        There is nothing in between <br>
        And in my eyes, there is a tiny dancer <br>
        Watching over me, he's singing <br>
        "She's a, she's a lady, and I am just a boy" <br>
        He's singing, "She's a, she's a lady, and I am just a line without a hook" <br>
    </p>

    <p>
            Baby, I am a wreck when I'm without you <br>
        I need you here to stay <br>
        I broke all my bones that day I found you <br>
        Crying at the lake <br>
        Was it something I said to make you feel like you're a burden? <br>
        Oh, and if I could take it all back
        <br>
        I swear that I would pull you from the tide 
        </p>
